# Fanimation - Online Fan Store Management System
Fanimation is a web-based application designed to manage an online store specializing in fans. It includes an admin dashboard for product and user management, a user interface for shopping and profile management, and a structured backend with database integration.

# Project Overview
Purpose: Manage products (e.g., fans with various colors, sizes, and specifications), user accounts, orders, and payments.
Technologies: PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap.
Structure: Organized into assets, includes, pages, and API directories for scalability and maintainability.

```
$host = "localhost";
